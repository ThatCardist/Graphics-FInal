Final Project: Neighborhood

Wesley Lang
CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2021


A scene made up of various buildings and other structures. You can walk around with
a camera and hopefully eventually take pictures of everything. Should start out seeing some of
the buildings and structures
TO DO:
implement the light in the lamp post but it is effecting the main lighting
camera flash on button press
I would like to improve the clouds and make trees more random


the fpv section is largely gotten from here:
https://thepentamollisproject.blogspot.com/2018/02/setting-up-first-person-camera-in.html
The lighting techniques are primarily adapted from ex13
Static camera a lot of ex21
